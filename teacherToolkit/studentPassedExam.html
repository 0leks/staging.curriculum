<p class="normal">
    Once a student has taken (and passed) an end-of-level exam, there are a few administrative steps to take:
                     </p><br>

<div class = "description">

    <br><br>
    <h3>Presentation to Student</h3>

     <br>
             <ul style ="list-style: disc;">
                   <li>Present the student with the lanyard pin for the level they passed.<br>
                       (Please ask a member of staff if you do not know where these are to be found)</li>
                 <li>Take a photo of the student and email it to <a href="mailto:info@jointheleague.org">The League admin</a></li>
                 <li>Ask the student if they would like to receive a printed certificate.</li>
    </ul>
          <br><br>        
                 
     <h3>Register the Event with The League</h3>
                 <br>
            <ul style ="list-style: disc;">
                <li>Enter the student details, level passed, grade, certificate wanted, etc. via the <a href="http://jointheleague.github.io/">Teacher Quick links</a> page</li><br>
                 <li>The above process should trigger moving the student into a higher level class. If by the following week this has not happened, please email <a href="mailto:info@jointheleague.org">The League admin</a></li>

            </ul>
    
      <br><br>                                  
    <h3>Move the Student Code to their GitHub</h3>
      <br>
    <p class="normal">
    While the student is working in a particular League level, their code is managed by The League's GitHub organization.<br><br>
    For example: in Level 0, the code is managed by League-Level0-Student<br><br>
        Before the student starts working on the next level, they should save the code they have written to their own GitHub as described in the following <a href="http://league-central.github.io/curriculum/teacherToolkit/TransferYourCode.html">Tutorial</a>
                     </p><br>
