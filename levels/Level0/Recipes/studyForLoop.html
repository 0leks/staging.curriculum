      There are 3 parts of a for loop separated by semi-colons. Here is an example:
   
<pre>for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){
}
</pre>
In the above example:<br><br>
<font color="green">
 int i = 0 ; </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an example of code executed once, before the loop starts. It is often used to initialize a counter with a value of zero. In this example the counter is called i but it can be any legal variable name.<br><br>
<font color="green"> i &lt; 10 ;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an example of a boolean condition ( just like the ones used in if statements). The loop will continue to repeat as long as this condition is true <br><br>
<font color="green"> i++</font> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an example of code that is executed at the end of the loop every time the loop repeats. In the example, it is adding one to the counter.<br><br>

Here is another example of a for loop:
<pre>
for ( int i = 10; i > 0; i-=2){
}</pre>                
          
In this example, the start code sets the counter to 10, then subtracts 2 each time the loop repeats until it reaches 0.<br>
Notice that the condition is i greater than 0 ( i &gt; 0 ) because the counter is now counting down.<br><br>
You can put a for loop inside another for loop (this is called nesting), but they usually use different variables like this:
<pre>
for ( int i = 10; i &gt; 0; i-- ){
    for ( int j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++ ) {
        System.out.println("Loop");
    }
}</pre>
In the above example, the inside loop will repeat 10 times for every one execution of the outside loop. This will result in "Loop" being printed 100 times.
