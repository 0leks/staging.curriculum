You can write and call methods in your program to perform specific functions. Here is an example of a method called drawSquare:
    
 <pre>void drawSquare(){
    for (int i= 0; i &lt; 4; i++){
        rob.move(100);
        rob.turn(90);
    }
}</pre>
    The first line of a method is called its signature. In the above method the signature contains the following:<br><br>
    <font color="green">void</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is an example of the type of information the method will return. In this case 'void' means nothing will be returned by this method.<br><br>
<font color="green">drawSquare</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the method, that you will use to call it.<br><br>
    <font color="green">(  )</font> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tells you what parameters the method needs. In this case it doesnâ€™t need any so they are empty.<br><br>
    <font color="green">{ }</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put all the code that the method will contain between its curly brackets.<br><br>
The method signature tells you what code you need to write when you call it. You would call the above method like this:
    <pre>drawSquare();</pre>
Here is another method:
<pre>int sevenTimes(int number){
	return number * 7;
}</pre>
    <font color="green">int</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tells you this method is going to a return an int so the code to call it will need an int variable for this information. 
    In the method, you see a return statement. A method that is not void, must have a return statement.
    <br><br>
<font color="green">sevenTimes</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the name of the method, that you will use when you call it.<br><br>
    <font color="green">(int number)</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tells you what parameters the method needs. In this case it needs you to pass it an int. In the example below, we are passing in the number 2.
    
    <pre>int answer = sevenTimes(2);</pre>
    The value of answer after the method finishes will be 14.
