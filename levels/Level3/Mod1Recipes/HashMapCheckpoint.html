<h1>HashMap Checkpoint</h1>

<p class="normal">

Teacher-led. Before starting, make sure every student has imported their Module 1 Java Project into Eclipse. Check that all programs are closed but students have selected the default package in the Eclipse Package Explorer.<br>
<br>
    Instruct students to do the following - check student screens to monitor understanding.<br>
    <br>
    Help students who are stuck, but note lack of mastery.
    <br>
    <br>
 <pre>
   1. Create a new class called Checkpoint.

   2. Add a main method to the class.

   3. Create a HashMap with keys and values of Strings. You will need to import java.util.HashMap.

   4. Add 5 entries to the HashMap. The keys will be Enlish words and the values will be the translation
      of those words into a language of your choice. If you don't know any other language, feel free to
      make one up.

   5. Use a for loop to print the keys and values of the HashMap side by side.
