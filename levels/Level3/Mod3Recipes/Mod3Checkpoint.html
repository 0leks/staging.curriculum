<h1>Module 3 Checkpoint</h1>

<p class="normal">

Teacher-led. Before starting, make sure every student has imported their Module 3 Java Project into Eclipse. Check that all programs are closed but students have selected the default package in the Eclipse Package Explorer.<br>
<br>
    Instruct students to do the following - check student screens to monitor understanding.<br>
    <br>
    Help students who are stuck, but note lack of mastery.
    <br>
    <br>
 <pre>
   1. Create an interface called Drawable

   2. Add an abstract void method called draw that takes no parameters.

   3. Create an abstract class called Animation.

   4. Add a method called getFramerate that takes no parameters but returns an int.

   5. Create a class called Animation2D. Make this class a subclass of Animation
      and make it implement Drawable.

   6. Override the draw method to simply print "drawing"

   7. Override the getFramerate method to return 24.

   8. Add a main method and create an Animation2D object.

   9. Call the draw method and getFramerate method. Print the result.

   EXTRA: 10. Create a new interface called Renderable.

          11. Add an abstract void method with no parameters called render.

          12. Create a new subclass of Animation called Animation3D that
              implements Renderable.

          13. Override the render method to do something cool of your choice.
