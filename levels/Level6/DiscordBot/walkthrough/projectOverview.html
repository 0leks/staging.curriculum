                        We're going to make a discord bot! It will listen in our discord channel for a specific
                        command to be issued, and then run some sort of logic and send a message in the
                        channel.<br><br>

                    <h3 style="font-size:large">Create three new features for the bot.</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Feature 1</h4>
                    <p>Your first feature should be very simple, just to get comfortable with how the bot
                        works. It should listen for the command, and then send a simple response</p>
                    <h4>Feature 2</h4>
                    <p>Your second feature should include some sort of interaction between the user and the bot.
                        This could mean simply taking a second word as part of the command as a "parameter", or making
                        some sort of game that spans multiple commands.</p>
                    <h4>Feature 3</h4>
                    <p>Challenge yourself! Use an API to retrieve data from another service, or make a challenging
                        game. This feature should be something that you don't already feel comfortable
                        accomplishing.</p>
                    <h3 style="font-size:large">Additional Requirements</h3>
                    <br />
                    <ul>

                        <li>Each feature should have a help embed. This will provide details about your feature when
                            the user types "!help" into the chat. For implementation details, please view the
                            constructor of RandomNumber.java. You need to also add your help embed to the HelpEmbed
                            listener as is done for the RandomNumber feature inside of Bot.java
                        </li>
                        <li>Each feature should be properly unit tested.  Our goal is 100% test coverage for your feature's code.
                            A good place to start is the tests provided for the example features, as a lot of those tests will
                            be applicable to your features.  If you feature is merged and doesn't contain an appropriate number of unit
                            tests, or it breaks the development branch, it will be completely removed.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once a single feature is done, create a pull request for it to merge it back into the
                            development branch. Please do not create a pull request that contains multiple features,
                            as it is much more time consuming to verify. In the message for your pull request,
                            include the command used to run your feature, as well as a little background information
                            about what it is supposed to do
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3 style="font-size:large">Review three pull requests created by someone else</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you review a pull request, you should clone the repository and run that branch to
                            verify that the feature works as expected
                        </li>
                        <li>Verify that the feature contains a help embed</li>
                        <li>Verify that the feature has unit tests, and that they all pass</li>
                        <li>If you find an issue with the feature, leave a comment on the pull request that outlines
                            the issues that you found
                        </li>
                        <li>If you find that everything is working correctly, approve the pull request</li>
                    </ul>
