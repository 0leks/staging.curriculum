                            We're going to make a discord bot! It will listen in our discord channel for a specific
                            command to be issued, and then run some sort of logic and send a message in the
                            channel.<br><br>

                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your first feature should be very simple, just to get comfortable with how the bot
                                works.</li>
                            <li>Each feature should have a help embed. This will provide details about your feature when
                                the user types "!help" into the chat. For implementation details, please view the
                                constructor of RandomNumber.java. You need to also add your help embed to the HelpEmbed
                                listener as is done for the RandomNumber feature inside of Bot.java</li>
                            <li>Once a single feature is done, create a pull request for it to merge it back into the
                                develpment branch. Please do not create a pull request that contains multiple features,
                                as it is much more time consuming to verify. In the message for your pull request,
                                include the command used to run your feature, as well as a little background information
                                about what it is supposed to do</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you review a pull request, you should clone the repository and run that branch to
                                verify that the feature works as expected</li>
                            <li>Verify that the feature contains a help embed</li>
                            <li>If you find an issue with the feature, leave a comment on the pull request that outlines
                                the issues that you found</li>
                            <li>If you find that everything is working correctly, approve the pull request</li>
                        </ul>
