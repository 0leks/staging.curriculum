    <h1>Running Race - Explaining Static</h1>
    <br>
    The static keyword is a reserved word in Java like int, for, if, and else.<br>
    It can be placed before the type when declaring member variables:<br>
    <pre>
static int var = 1;
static Robot rob;
    </pre>
    and before the return type for method definitions:<br>
    <pre>
static float calculateArea(float width, float height){ // code }
public static void main(String[] args){ // code }
    </pre>
    <br>
    A member variable without static <b>DOES NOT</b> exist before an object/instance of a class is made.<br>
    A member variable with static <b>DOES</b> exist before an object/instance of a class is made.<br>
    Take the Athlete class for example:<br>
    <pre>
public class Athlete {
  /*
   * static member variables
   */
  static String raceLocation = "New York";
  static String raceStartTime = "9.00am";
  
  /*
   * non-static member variables
   */
  String name;
  int speed;
  int bibNumber;
  
  Athlete (String name, int speed){
      this.name = name;
      this.speed = speed;
  }
  
  /*
   * static method
   */
  static double calculateDuration(double startSec, double finishSec){ // code }
  
  /*
   * non-static method
   */
  void run(){ // code }
}
    </pre>
    <br>
    The static member variables in the Athlete class can be a accessed and modified without an object/instance of Athlete.<br>
    This does not work for non-static member variables:<br>
    <pre>
Athlete.raceLocation = "NYC";           // OK!
Athlete.name = "Jim";                   // ERROR!

Athlete jim = new Athlete("Jim", 10);   // Athlete object/instance jim

jim.raceLocation = "Boston";            // OK!
jim.name = "Jimmy"                      // OK!
    </pre>

    There is only 1 static member variable for all objects of a class.<br>
    There are unique variables for each object of a class. For example:<br>
    <pre>
Athlete jim = new Athlete("Jim", 10);
Athlete amy = new Athlete("Amy", 6);

System.out.println(jim.name);           // prints "jim"
System.out.println(amy.name);           // prints "amy"
System.out.println(jim.raceStartTime);  // prints "9.00am"
System.out.println(amy.raceStartTime);  // prints "9.00am"
</pre>
In this example changing raceStartTime for jim to "10.00am" also changes the raceStartTime for amy.<br>
The raceStartTime variable is the same for jim and amy.<br>
<br>
static methods can also be called before an object of a class exists, while non-static methods can't:
<pre>
Athlete.calculateDuration(0.0, 14.7);   // OK!
Athlete.run();                          // ERROR!
Athlete jim = new Athlete("Jim", 10);
jim.run();                              // OK!
jim.calculateDuration(0.0, 14.7);       // OK!
    </pre>
    This is why non-static member variables can't be placed inside of static methods.<br>
    Static methods can be called before an object is created when non-static member variables haven't been created yet!<br>
