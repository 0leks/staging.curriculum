Goal: Make a program using Swing and Model-View-Controller design architecture.<br><br>
The program will have a window (frame) with a number of buttons that will show different videos when clicked. There will be FOUR Java classes to complete this program.
</p><br>                 
                
                
                
                
<ol id="recipePage">
       <h4>Make the View</h4><br>     
  <li>This class will have a frame, a panel, and some buttons. NOTE: because this GUI has more than one button, you must add a JPanel to your JFrame and put the buttons on the panel! The View will need to have a variable for the controller (because it will need a mouse listener).</li>
    
     <li>The runner class needs a main method and will create the view object when the program is run.</li> 
   
    
<h4>Connect a Controller</h4><br>   
      <li>Make the controller a mouse listener so it can process mouse clicks.</li>    
    
    <li>Connect the controller to the model.</li>
        
     <li>Add code to the controller for each of the buttons on the view.</li>
    
    
 <h4>Complete the Model</h4><br>     
 
            <li>Use the code below for the cutest videos ever. <br>
<pre>
String ducks = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q";
String frog ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBkWhkAZ9ds";
String unicorns = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-xWhG4UU_Y"; 
</pre>
                <br>
              
Note: If any of these video links no longer work, go to youtube and get replacements. Use the String names to give you a hint about what the videos contain
