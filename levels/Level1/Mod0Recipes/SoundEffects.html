<h1>Sound Effects Machine</h1>
<br>
                
<p id="recipePage">
Goal: Make a program using Swing and Model-View-Controller design architecture.<br><br>
The program will have a window (frame) with a number of buttons that will play different sound effects when clicked. There will be FOUR Java classes to complete this program.
</p><br>                
                
                
<ol id="recipePage">
      <h4>Make the View</h4><br>  

       <li>This class will have a frame, a panel, and some buttons. NOTE: because this GUI has more than one button, you must add a JPanel to your JFrame and put the buttons on the panel! The View will need to have a variable for the controller (because it will need a mouse listener).</li>
            
    <li>The runner class creates the view object when the program is run</li> 
            
            
         <h4>Connect a Controller</h4><br>          
      <li>Make the controller a mouse listener so it can process mouse clicks. The controller acts as the go-between so has variables for the view and model</li>      
     <li>Add code to the controller for each of the buttons on the view.</li>
    
           <h4>Complete the Model</h4><br>  
            <li>A sample sound effect has been provided. Add some more of your own here.<br>
            <br>
             <u>They must be .wav files.</u> Free sound effects can be found <a href="http://soundbible.com/free-sound-effects-1.html">here</a>. The League also has an account at <a href="https://freesound.org/">freesound</a>. Ask your teacher for our login.<br><br>
            The .wav files must be <u>placed into your sound effects recipe package</u> (drag and drop).</li>

        If you need help, take a look at the previous recipes in this module. Drum Kit is a good one to look at since it also plays sound files and will have a lot of methods you can use.<br>
