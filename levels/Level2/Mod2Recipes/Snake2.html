<h1>Snake - Part 2</h1>
 <br>
<p class="normal">
    Now we will get the snake to move around, change direction when the arrow keys are pressed, and grow when it eats the food.
    
                      <h2>1. More Game Variables</h2>        
    
                    <p class="normal">Find the Game Variables section of the starter code.</p><br>
<ul>
                    <li> Create and initialize an int variable to hold the direction of your snake. Initialize this variable to UP ( a Processing constant ).
    </li>

    <li>Create and initialize an int variable to hold how many pieces of food the snake has eaten.</li>
</ul>
                    
                      <h2>2. Control Methods</h2>  


                     <h4>move()</h4>                      
 <br>
<ul>
                    <li>Complete the if-else if statement provided in the starter code and make sure it uses your direction variable.</li>
                    
<li>Call the checkBoundaries method after the switch statement to make sure the snake doesn't go off the screen.</li>
                    <li>Call the move method in the draw method, <u>before</u> drawSnake().</li>
                    </ul>

<br>
                     <h4>checkBoundaries()</h4>  
                    <br>
<ul>
                    <li>       
Add code to this method to check if the snake's head is out of bounds (if it is, teleport your snake to the opposite side).
    </li></ul>
                     
                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>keyPressed()</h4>   
       <br>
<ul>
                    <li>
                        Add code to this method to set the direction variable to the keyCode of the key that was pressed. Hint: To understand this better, check it out in the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/keyCode.html">Processing Reference</a> .</li>
    <li>
        Make sure that the key for your current direction’s opposite doesn’t work  (ex. if you’re going up, the down key shouldn’t have any effect)</li>
</ul>
<br>
                    <h4>eat()</h4>   
       <br>

Add code to this method to check if the head is in the same spot as the piece of food. If it is, the food must be eaten as follows:<br>
                    <br>
   <ul><li>Increment the variable that keeps track of food eaten</li>
        <li>Drop a new piece of food for the snake to find.</li>
        
        
    </ul><br>
    Call the eat method at the end of the draw method, after drawSnake().

                           <h2>3. Testing</h2>

               </p> 
                    <br>
                         <ul>
                    <li>The "snake" should now move and change direction when the arrow keys are pressed (within the rules described above).</li>
                        <li>Test that the snake reappears on the opposite side of the game when it should</li>
                    <li>If the snake moves over the food, a new piece of food should be drawn.</li>
                    </ul>
